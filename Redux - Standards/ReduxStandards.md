# Redux - Standards


At DealerSocket all our React applications use Redux.

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable application state manager for JavaScript apps that [favors a functional programming](https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-mobx-confusion/) approach with immutable data which can make it easier to test and reason about.

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is not specific to Reactâ€”it can also be used with AngularJS, Ember and other similar FrontEnd frameworks.

Using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage the state of your front-end application enables you to migrate or add new connected __containers__ components to existing applications written in AngularJS, Ember or other frameworks.
